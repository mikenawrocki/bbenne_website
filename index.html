<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Bryan Bennett, as you know. You made it to this domain after all.
My pronouns are he/him/his.</p>
<p>I'm a software developer, working for the <a href="https://gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/cybersecurity-information-protection-and-hardware-evaluation-research">CIPHER lab at GTRI</a>.
Mostly, I write web services and pretend to be a &quot;software architect&quot;.
Sometimes, I get to play around with cooler things like formal verification, software-assurance, functional languages, etc.
I live in Atlanta with my small family.
I try to get outdoors when I can.</p>
<p>I'm a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, a social music fraternity.
I am a past-president of the Atlanta-Area Alumni Association actually.</p>
<p>Basically, I'm just a dad who likes loud music,
has strong opinions about computers
and enjoys walking and sitting in the woods.</p>
<h2>What is this?</h2>
<p>That remains to be seen.
I'll eventually add some overlays about some of my projects here or something.
For now, you can find me in the places linked below.</p>
<h3>This is a cool color scheme!</h3>
<p>Isn't it?
It's called <a href="https://earl-grey.halt.wtf/">earl grey</a> and I think it's really neat.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="https://halt.wtf">June</a>!</p>
